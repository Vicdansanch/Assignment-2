# Assignment-2

1. Walk us through the design of your project. Why did you design your project the way you did? What difficulties did you overcome?
  the most difficult part was getting the right routes for the project , since most of the issues i had were troubles because of 
  not declarated variables

2. How did you test your project to verify that it works? If you used any specific curl requests, let us know.
I applied the curl requests the guidelines gave us so it would be just fine changing the path request for comments 

3. Let us know if anything doesn't work as intended so your reviewers will know ahead of time

Until now most of the issues were coming from my errors , so hopefully there wont be any of those.
